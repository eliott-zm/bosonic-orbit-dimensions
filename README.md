# bosonic-orbit-dimensions

Simple Python implementation of methods described in paper "Orbit dimensions in Linear and Gaussian quantum optics".

## Requirements:

Requires only `numpy` (and optionally Jupyter notebooks to run the code).

- ### Example usage, using [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/):
    After cloning the repo, run
    
    ```shell
    uv sync
    ```
    Finally, open the notebook `example.ipynb` through either `uv run jupyter-lab`, or using VSCode: `code .`.
